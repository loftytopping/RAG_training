# üìò Medical Imaging Classification & Retrieval-Augmented Generation & M

This repository contains hands-on notebooks focused on two complementary areas of applied machine learning:

## üß† 1. Medical Imaging with Deep Learning & Transfer Learning

Work through the complete pipeline of classifying chest X-ray images using convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. This includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing from the COVID‚Äë19 Radiography dataset
- Model training using Keras (CNNs & EfficientNet/MobileNet)
- Evaluation with Grad-CAM and confusion matrices
- Hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner

> üìå **Notebook**: `Radiography_classifier-2.ipynb`
>
> üñºÔ∏è **Dataset Access Notice**  
The radiography dataset used in this project will be **provided privately during the CDT programme** and must **not be redistributed or shared** publicly.
> If you wish to access it independently, the dataset is publicly available at:  
üëâ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

## üîç 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Language Models

Explore how to build an intelligent RAG pipeline that can retrieve relevant documents and generate accurate, grounded responses using state-of-the-art language models. The notebook walks through:

- Text embeddings and vector stores (e.g., FAISS)
- Prompt construction and document retrieval
- End-to-end integration with RAG-style pipelines

> üìå **Notebook**: `RAG_example-2.ipynb`

> üìÑ *Note: Academic PDF content used in this example will be shared during the CDT. Details and citations will be added here.*

## üöÄ Course Requirements

All sessions and notebooks in this course will be delivered using **Google Colab**.

> ‚úÖ You must have a **Google account** to participate.


### Transfering Jupyter notebooks to Google Colab

By clicking on the Google Colab link below it will take you to the Google Colab platform. The first thing you see will be some Python code, running in a Jupyter notebook. Click anywhere in the code block and then, to the left hand side, you will see a 'play' button. If you click this button Google Colab will run the code in there. This code essentially creates a new folder on your Google Drive and then mounts that drive before downloading the  course. **You will need to confirm you are happy linking your google account to proceed*. In fact, everytime you re-open the course material there is some code to re-mount your google drive. You will be asked if you approve this. If you do not, it is likely you will not be able to access the data used in the examples.

Once complete you can then run through the course material from your Google account. 

- [![Open notebook In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/loftytopping/Aerosol_CDT_summer_training/blob/master/Setup_GoogleColab.ipynb)

**when accessing Colab you will need to specify a GPU runtime**

### üìÅ Uploading Data

Before running the notebooks, please upload the required datasets to your own Google Drive.

üì§ **Upload link**: [Google Drive Upload Folder](https://drive.google.com)  
_Use the provided zip or folder download shared by the CDT, then upload it to your Drive manually._

## üîê API Key Requirements

To run all features of these notebooks, you'll need access to external APIs:

### ‚úÖ OpenAI API Key
- Required for language model inference (e.g., GPT-based retrieval/generation).
- **This key will be provided to you by the CDT.**
- üîç **What to look for**:
  ```python
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-key-here"
  ```

### ‚úÖ Hugging Face Access Token
- Required to access certain models or datasets through the Hugging Face Hub.
- You must **create your own** token at: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
- üîç **What to look for to insert the token in the notebook**:
  ```python
  os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "your-huggingface-token-here"
  ```

Once you have your keys:
- **Never commit API keys to public repositories. The CDT provided OpenAI key will be disabled shortly after the course.**
