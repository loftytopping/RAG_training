    "#1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ##\n",
    "\n",
    "> **“Bring your own knowledge base to the language model.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1a. Why do we need RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or **RAG**, is a powerful method that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with access to external information sources such as documents, websites, or databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple: instead of expecting the language model to know everything, we **retrieve relevant content on demand** from your own data, and provide that context to the model as part of the prompt. The result is a more accurate, up-to-date, and trustworthy response... in principle :)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarise this below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Challenge | Consequence without RAG |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| LLMs are **trained on a fixed snapshot** of the internet. | They may be *out of date* or simply *lack niche domain details*. |\n",
    "| They have a limited context window. | We can’t fit entire libraries of PDFs or long knowledge bases into a single prompt. |\n",
    "| Pure LLM generation can hallucinate. | Answers may be fluent but **factually wrong** or missing citations. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are impressive, but they come with key limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are trained on a **fixed dataset**, which means they may lack recent developments, niche scientific knowledge, or anything outside their training cutoff.\n",
    "- They can **hallucinate** facts — generating answers that sound correct but are actually untrue.\n",
    "- They have a **limited context window** — you can’t fit an entire research paper or website into one prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG solves these problems by **bringing in external knowledge at runtime** — just before asking the model to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b). How RAG works — two-step loop\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, RAG is a two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve**: When a user asks a question, we first **search a custom knowledge source** (like uploaded PDFs or a scraped website) to find the most relevant text passages. This is typically done using semantic search with **embeddings** (vector representations of text), although keyword search can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate**: We then pass both the **question and the retrieved text** to the language model. The model uses this injected context to generate a grounded and accurate answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the model **temporary access to specific information** — like letting it “look something up” before answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say a student asks:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“What are the health risks associated with indoor mold exposure?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard language model might give a generic answer — or hallucinate.  \n",
    "With RAG, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search a folder of academic papers on environmental health and find 3 passages about mold exposure.\n",
    "- Pass those passages along with the question into GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.\n",
    "- The model now generates an answer that draws directly from the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This answer is both accurate and traceable to real sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1c). Why RAG is powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Up-to-date** — you can swap in fresh documents without retraining the model.  \n",
    "* **Domain-specific** — feed the LLM specialised papers, policies, codebases, etc.  \n",
    "* **Explainable** — you can surface the exact passages returned by the retriever as citations.  \n",
    "* **Cost-efficient** — store millions of documents in a vector index; send only the top-k snippets to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1d). Typical RAG pipeline in practice\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In Retrieval-Augmented Generation, we first **break long texts into smaller “chunks”** and then **turn each chunk into a numeric vector** (an *embedding*). These two steps—*chunking* and *embedding*—are the backbone of the retrieval phase.\n",

    "#### Why do we chunk documents?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Context-window limits**. Even GPT-4o can read only a few thousand tokens at once. A 20-page PDF can easily exceed that limit.\n",
    "* **Granular retrieval**. When a user asks a question, we want to pull back *just the most relevant passages*—not an entire 20-page paper.\n",
    "* **Reduced hallucinations**. Smaller, focused chunks lower the risk of the model mis-summarising unrelated sections.\n",

Additionally, hypersensitivity pneumonitis can occur in individuals susceptible to immune-mediated conditions. Mold exposure can also lead to respiratory symptoms, asthma, and infections, especially with spore-forming molds. Allergic responses, both IgE and IgG mediated, have been associated with exposure to indoor molds. Uncommon allergic syndromes such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and allergic fungal sinusitis have also been linked to mold exposure.\n",

    "**Hybrid search** combines two powerful retrieval techniques:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Keyword search** (exact match): looks for passages that contain specific terms or phrases, ensuring high *precision*.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the user asks:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “What are the symptoms of mold exposure in children?”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector search** might retrieve a chunk that says:  \n",
    "  *“Mold exposure is associated with respiratory symptoms in young individuals...”*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keyword search** would retrieve a chunk containing:  \n",
    "  *“Common mold symptoms in children include...”*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hybrid search** retrieves both kinds — ensuring high relevance *and* precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Benefits of Hybrid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "- Captures **semantic nuance** *and* **exact match**\n",
    "- Improves retrieval quality for scientific or legal texts\n",
    "- Useful when queries must include specific terms (e.g., “asthma”, “children”, “mold”)\n",
    "- Ideal when users might **expect exact keywords**, but **ask imprecisely**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid search is especially valuable in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where high-quality context directly affects answer quality. It ensures the LLM sees *both semantically relevant* and *precisely matching* content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Hybrid-Search Weighting Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When we merge **semantic** (vector) and **keyword** signals, we often want to *rank* the results rather than simply concatenating two lists.  \n",
    "We do this by giving each signal a **weight** and computing a *composite score* for every candidate chunk.\n",

    "| `k`      | Keyword score (e.g., how many keywords appear in the chunk), scaled to 0-1 |\n",
    "| `α` (alpha) | Weight for semantic score (default 0.7) |\n",
    "| `β` (beta)  | Weight for keyword score  (default 0.3) |\n",
    "| Composite | `score = α·s + β·k` (higher = better) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the question includes critical terms (“children”, “asthma”), keyword recall becomes essential.  \n",
    "* Semantic vectors may rank a chunk highly even if it never mentions the *exact* term you care about.  \n",
    "* Weighting lets you tune that balance: `α = 1.0` → pure semantic; `β = 1.0` → pure keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll now implement a hybrid retriever that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Runs FAISS to get top-`m` candidates (we’ll use `m = 20` for a wider net)  \n",
    "2. Computes a keyword score for *all* chunks (or just the FAISS candidates)  \n",
    "3. Combines the two scores with weights `α` and `β`  \n",

    "<h4>🔍 Expand Your Skills</h4>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Experiment with different embedding models like <code>OpenAI</code>, <code>Cohere</code>, or <code>HuggingFace Transformers</code>.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Swap out the vector store backend (e.g., try <code>Chroma</code>, <code>Weaviate</code>, or <code>Qdrant</code>) to compare retrieval performance.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Explore hybrid retrieval methods (dense + keyword-based) for improved relevance.</li>\n",
